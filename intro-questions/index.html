                    I wanted to take this class because I'm interested in the combination of design and computer science. I'm really interested to learn how to physically build and artistically compose a website.

                    I hope to learn more about what goes in to the design process for developing a website.

                    Designing for a screen is going to be interesting because we have to keep in mind the many different screen sizes that exist, and find a way to adapt our content when screens change in size.

                    https://lookbook.wtf/ I love this website because it's unique and exciting to explore. I think the artist does a really good job of giving his audience an idea of the scope of his work. Though a bit chaotic and not the easiest to digest, the colors and heirachy of the site work really well for this designer.
