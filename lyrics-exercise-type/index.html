    <h1>
        In the Aeroplane Over the Sea
    </h1>

    <p>
    What a beautiful face I have found in this place
    </p>
    <p>That is circling all 'round the sun.</p>
    <p>
     What a beautiful dream 
    </p>
    <p>That could flash on the screen</p>
    <p>In a blink of an eye and be gone from me.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 40px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom:0px; font-style: oblique;">
        Soft and sweet
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me hold it close and keep it here with me.
    </p>

    <p>
        And one day we will die
        </p>
        <p>
            And our ashes will fly From the aeroplane over the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
            But for now we are young
        </p>
        <p> Let us lay in the sun </p>
        <p>And count every beautiful thing we can see. </p>
        <p>Love to be</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 40px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom:0px;  font-style: oblique;">
            Soft and sweet
        </p>
        <p>
            In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me
        </p>

        <p>
            What a curious life we have found here tonight 
            </p>
            <p>There is music that sounds from the street.</p>
            <p>
                There are lights in the clouds Anna's ghost all around 
            </p>
            <p>Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 40px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom:0px;  font-style: oblique;">
                Soft and sweet
            </p>
            <p>
                How the notes all bend and reach above the trees.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now how I remember you 
                </p>
                <p>How I would push my fingers through </p>
                <p>Your mouth to make those muscles move,</p>
                <p>
                    That made your voice so smooth and sweet.
                </p>
                <p> But now we keep where we don't know</p>
                <p>
                    All secrets sleep in winter clothes With one you loved so long ago 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now he don't even know his name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What a beautiful face I have found in this place 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is circling all 'round the sun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And when we meet on a cloud I'll be laughing out loud I'll be laughing with everyone I see,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all.
                    </p>
